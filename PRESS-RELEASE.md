## Heading ##
  > Hey, look where Malek went! @ heylookwheremalekwent.com

## Sub-Heading ##
  > An easy to understand travel blog with a captivating user interface.

## Summary ##
  > Although I have seen and experienced many astounding things in my travels, what I haven't found is a good website template with which to present my stories. Thus, I decided to make one! My website features an interactive map. Every blog post I make will correspond to a point on the map; to learn about a particular place, just click on the marker and it will take you to my post about it.

## Problem ##
  > There are a million and a half travel blogs nowadays. I want mine to stand out, so I am leveraging my web design skills.

## Solution ##
  > My product makes it easier to see at a glance where the author of the blog has been, and allows users to go straight to the posts that they're interested in reading.

## Quote from You ##
  > "I built this website not just to share my experiences with the world, but to motivate myself to fill the map with as many markers as possible."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Simply go to the website, and click on one of the markers on the map to get started.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Everyone and their mother blogs about their travels. But no one presents it so beautifully as Malek does!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Thank you for sharing in my experiences. I encourage you to go out and see the world for yourself, so that one day you can have a map covered in dots.
